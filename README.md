# <Document and Database Query System for Enhanced User Interaction>
### - This project involves the development of a sophisticated chatbot capable of seamlessly handling both document management and database querying to improve user experience and interaction.

### - The system also integrates advanced natural language processing capabilities, allowing the chatbot to understand and respond to user queries about a certain database. The chatbot can generate and execute SQL queries, fetch relevant data, and even create various types of visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps. Additionally, the system supports location-based queries, providing maps and triangular area visualizations based on user input.

### - Users can also upload PDF documents via a user-friendly interface, and ask questions about them.
